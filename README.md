## Features

Step-by-Step Algorithm Execution

Visualizes BFS, DFS, sorting algorithms, and dynamic programming in discrete steps.

Interactive Controls

Play, pause, step forward/backward, and restart animations.

Data Structure Visualization

Animates arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, and DP tables to show real-time changes.

Custom Input Support

Users can provide custom arrays, graphs, or tree structures to see algorithm behavior.

Algorithm Comparison (optional)

Compare different approaches (e.g., BFS vs DFS, Merge Sort vs Quick Sort) side by side.

Step Descriptions & Tooltips

Each step includes a brief explanation of the operation or decision made.

Dynamic Highlighting

Highlights active elements, pointers, visited nodes, or current recursion path.

Responsive Web Interface

Works on desktop and tablet screens, clean UI with TailwindCSS.

Playback Speed Control (optional)

Adjust animation speed for faster or slower step visualization.

Algorithm Library

Preloaded common LeetCode
